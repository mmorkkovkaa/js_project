                        <p>The World Ninja Wars are called the biggest and worst divisions of nations. In the shinobi world, there have been several clashes of this magnitude, causing the entire country to be engulfed in war. </p>

                        <h4>World War I</h4>
                        <p>This war was the first war in which most of the villages and countries participate. The war went on for a very long time and became the epitome of all wars. The war ended with the fact that between the great countries an armistice agreement was concluded. This happened after most of them had suffered great damage and were unable to wage war. </p>

                        <h4>World War II</h4>
                        <p>Not much is known about those times, but it is known that
                            Konoha was led by the Third Hokage Sarutobi Hiruzen.
                            Konoha was at war with Sunagakure under the leadership of the Third Kazekage.
                            Iwagakure also participated in this war. Supposedly its leader was Third Tsuchikage Ōnoki.
                            Since all the battles took place on the territory of small countries, they were left devastated.
                            Therefore, at the head of Amegakure, Hanzo also led the military policy. ".</p>

                        <h4>World War III</h4>
                        <p>Konoha and Iwa fought in Kusagakure territory. When the Konoha shinobi led by Namikaze Minato destroyed the Kanabi Bridge, the war went in their favor. It is also known that Suna also took part in the war, since it was at this time that Sasori received the nickname "Sasori of the Red Sands". During the war, Minato earned his nickname "Yellow Lightning of Konoha". In addition, Hatake Kakashi received the Sharingan after the death of Obito Uchiha and was nicknamed "Kakashi's Copy Ninja".</p>

After that, the Godaikoku Shinobi form the Shinobi Alliance, whose base is in Kumogakure, the only village that has no connection to Akatsuki. The army of the union consists of 80,000 soldiers, most of whom hail from Shinobi Godaikoku or Tetsu no Kuni. This army is divided into five divisions and four teams.</p>
